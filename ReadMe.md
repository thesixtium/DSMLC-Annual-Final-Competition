# Happy Stocks

Have you ever wanted to **invest** in stocks based on the World Happiness Report? Do **you** want to lose money because of bad financial advice? Are stocks **also** meaningless to you? 

Well then you're a perfect client for Happy Stocks (tm)! Using machine learning on the World Happiness Report, we created the most mediocre machine learning algorithm to judge stocks.

Simply type in a NASDAQ stock ticker, and we'll rate it on how happy it makes you! If you're feeling "lucky", leave the field blank and we'll pick a random stock for you.

*Please don't actually invest based on this application. Or do. I'm not your mom :)*

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar. Navigate to the folder "DSMLC-Annual-Final-Competition" and pip install everything at once:

```bash
cd C:\Users\path\to\DSMLC-Annual-Final-Competition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I'm like 50.1% sure this installs everything you need (correctly)

## Usage

You don't actually run any python files by clicking on them! Everything is launched from frameworks via the terminal. Here is what you should do:

1. Navigate to the folder "DSMLC-Annual-Final-Competition"
```bash
cd C:\Users\path\to\DSMLC-Annual-Final-Competition
```

2. Launch the backend
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. Launch the website
```bash
streamlit run C:/Users/path/to/DSMLC-Annual-Final-Competition/app.py
```

4. Go to the website in your [local browser with port 8501](http://localhost:8501/)

## Contributing

I have no idea why you'd want to contribute to this project. You are welcome to submit a pull request, but I have no idea what they are or what to do with it. 

I've been told to say "For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change", but if I can't deal with pull requests I have no hope for issues.

I think I should use [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)? I am super unsure.
